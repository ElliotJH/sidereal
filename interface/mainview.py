# One thing I'm wondering about, is whether we implement the gui overlay
# in a seperate space. How does it intercept the clicks, and know which one
# is which? I guess we hope for panda magic.

# Right, in core homeworld, the camera is always focused on something, unless
# it's been destroyed. But my point that the camera always rotates and pivots
# around a central point. I'm sure we could implement "look around" later
# but first things need to rotate.

# things only rotate when the right mouse button is held down.

# Imagine we're on the surface of a sphere, which is centered around the point
# that we're looking at. Moving the mouse left rotates left from your
# perspective, and so on.
