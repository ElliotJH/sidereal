Sidereal Overview
=================

Sidereal is an open source game inspired by Relic's 1999 classic game
Homeworld. We aim to create an experience that is similar in gameplay and feel
to Homeworld, maybe you could call it a "spiritual successor".

 - A camera that can move around it's focused point, and zoom in and out.
 - Being able to move units around in 3D, not just in a 2D plane.
 - A finite amount of resources, gathered by dedicated units, which
   automatically move to the next location when one rock/cloud is exhausted.
 - An immersive singleplayer campaign.
 - Strike craft dog fights, taking into account formations, tactics, and gun
   coverage.
 - Large expensive capital ships warping through space, arriving all hulking
   and magnificent, and then start firing.
